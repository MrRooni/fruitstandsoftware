  <h1>iLife 09 Won't Install When the iPhone Simulator Is Running</h1><a href="index.html" title="7:59 PM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p>This post is a bit of a deviation from my usual posts, but it falls into the <strong>something-that-bit-me-that-might-bite-you-too-so-here&#8217;s-how-to-fix-it</strong> category.</p>

  <p>I recently upgraded to Snow Leopard by doing an erase and install. After getting everything back up and running I realized that I still needed to install iLife. I popped in disc 2 of my MacBook Pro install DVDs and proceeded to open the Install Bundled Software installer. After customizing my options I hit the install button and waited. And waited. And waited. The installer never got past the Preparing Bundled Applications stage.</p>

  <p>I checked out the console and saw a series of messages that ended with:<br>
  <code>10/17/09 4:23:10 PM Installer[8135] *** -[NSMachPort handlePortMessage:]: dropping incoming DO message because the connection or ports are invalid</code></p>

  <p>I decided to try a restart to see if that would fix my problem but shortly after restarting and before I could try my install again I cranked open Xcode and the iPhone simulator to check out something in <a href="http://www.getsportsbookapp.com/">my latest project</a>. Remember this part of the story, because it&#8217;s important.</p>

  <p>A few days later I remembered that I still needed to install iLife and grabbed my MacBook Pro installation discs again. I kicked off the installation and instantly hit the same issue. The installer never got past the Preparing Application Bundles stage. I opened Console.app again and saw the same message:<br>
  <code>10/20/09 7:39:40 PM Installer[9025] *** -[NSMachPort handlePortMessage:]: dropping incoming DO message because the connection or ports are invalid</code></p>

  <p>I decided to turn to Google and happily came across this gem of a radar filing: <a href="http://www.openradar.appspot.com/7105069">Installer hanging for any installer after uptime of X hours</a>. If you read through the comments on that bug you will find that the installer hang isn&#8217;t based on uptime, but rather on the iPhone Simulator running. I had been working on an iPhone project both times I tried to install iLife and it was causing the installer to hang (for some inexplicable reason).</p>

  <p>I quit the simulator and Installer.app immediately stopped trying to prepare the bundled applications and displayed an error. I quit the installer, tried again, and voila, everything worked as it should.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" title="View all posts in Uncategorized" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
