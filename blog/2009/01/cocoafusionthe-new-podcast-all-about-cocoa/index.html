  <h1>cocoaFusion:The new podcast all about Cocoa</h1><a href="index.html" title="11:15 AM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p>For those of you waiting for the next great thing in Cocoa development podcasts I humbly submit <a href="http://www.cocoafusion.net/">cocoaFusion:</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.cocoafusion.net/">cocoaFusion:</a> is hosted by Kevin Hoctor of <a href="http://nothirst.com/moneywell/">MoneyWell</a> fame, and Danny Greg the lead developer on <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/">Realmac Software</a>&#8216;s most recent release, <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/">LittleSnapper</a>. The pair decided to start a podcast of their own after being introduced on one of <a href="http://twitter.com/macdevnet">Scotty&#8217;s</a> excellent <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/">Mac Developer Network</a> shows.</p>

  <p>The idea behind <a href="http://www.cocoafusion.net/">cocoaFusion:</a> is for each Kevin and Danny to cover a coding problem that they&#8217;ve faced down since the last episode. The first episode has Kevin relating his experiences with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDateFormatter_Class/index.html">NSDateFormatter</a> while Danny goes in depth on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSPredicateEditor_class/index.html">NSPredicateEditor</a>.</p>

  <p>While the pair admits to some rough edges in the first episode, the overall quality of the show&#8217;s production and the ease with which Danny and Kevin relate to each other makes for a fantastic show that&#8217;s a pleasure to listen to.</p>

  <p>cocoaFusion: can be found on the web at <a href="http://www.cocoafusion.net/">cocoafusion.net</a> and in iTunes by following <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=301888038">this link</a>.</p>
