  <h1>Typinator and Xcode</h1><a href="index.html" title="11:59 AM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p>I recently acquired a free license of <a href="http://www.macility.com/products/typinator/">Typinator</a> through <a href="http://www.macheist.com/">MacHeist</a> and have been loving it. &#194;&nbsp;I put together a set of abbreviations for the text macros that &#194;&nbsp;Xcode provides and it has made my coding life much easier. &#194;&nbsp;A few folks have asked why I&#8217;m not using&#194;&nbsp;xctxtmacros and the truth is that I didn&#8217;t know about them. &#194;&nbsp;Either way, Typinator is working great.</p>

  <p>You can download my set of <a href="http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/?attachment_id=212">Xcode Abbreviations here</a>.&#194;&nbsp;&#194;&nbsp;Please note that it&#8217;s extremely limited as I only included those macros that I need most often. &#194;&nbsp;Leave a comment if there are any that you think I&#8217;m missing.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/cocoa/index.html" title="View all posts in Cocoa" rel="category tag">Cocoa</a>, <a href="../../../category/downloads/index.html" title="View all posts in Downloads" rel="category tag">Downloads</a>, <a href="../../../category/link/index.html" title="View all posts in Link" rel="category tag">Link</a>, <a href="../../../category/sample-code/index.html" title="View all posts in Sample Code" rel="category tag">Sample Code</a> and tagged <a href="../../../tag/code-reuse/index.html" rel="tag">code reuse</a>, <a href="../../../tag/typinator/index.html" rel="tag">Typinator</a>.

        <p>As noted on Twitter, you could just use .xctxtmacros to accomplish basically the same thing.<br>
        The main reasons to prefer them over your set of abbreviations that I can see:<br>
        &#226;&#8364;&#162; When written properly, Xcode&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s text macros can adapt to your coding style (as defined by the XCCodeSenseFormattingOptions defaults dict).<br>
        &#226;&#8364;&#162; A single macro can be set up to insert either a placeholder or the current clipboard/selection (I&#226;&#8364;&#8482;m not sure which at the moment&#226;&#8364;&#166;), which is nice for bracketing expressions, say. (You&#226;&#8364;&#8482;d have to create one abbreviation for a placeholder and a second one for the clipboard with Typinator.)<br>
        &#226;&#8364;&#162; You can bind keys to your macros in the Xcode Preferences. For example, I have ?[ set up to insert brackets, ^( for matching parens etc.</p>

        <p>The downside seems to be that you can&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t use non-alphanumeric abbreviation triggers for xctxtmacros (at least my Xcode won&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t autocomplete them although they show up in the completion pop-up).</p>

        <p>You might also want to check out ODCompletion Dictionary[1], if only for the huge set of abbreviations they provide. Or wait for me to tidy up my set of xctxtmacros (I&#226;&#8364;&#8482;ve ported pretty much all of ODCompletionDictionary and still want to add a few TextMate-inspired scripts; ETA: Real Soon Now <img src='../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley'> .</p>

        <p>In any way, thanks for sharing!</p>

        <p>Cheers,<br>
        Martin (who needs an abbreviation for his name&#226;&#8364;&#8221;it&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s insane how often I mistype it&#226;&#8364;&#166;)</p>
