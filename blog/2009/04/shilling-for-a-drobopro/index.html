  <p>That&#8217;s right, I want to win a Drobo, and I&#8217;m more than willing to use my blog to win one. &#194;&nbsp;Here&#8217;s the deal:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Hey would you like to win a Drobo? All you have to do is link from your blog or website to <a href="http://mydl.me/">MYDL.ME</a>. That&#8217;s it &#8211; must be 18 and live in a country where Drobo ships to be eligible. We&#8217;re going to pick a winner on March 31 so get your link up now. We&#8217;re going to check our referral logs to pick the winner. Good luck. &#8212; P.S. If you don&#8217;t win but you&#8217;d like a good deal on a Drobo check this out. If you want to buy a 2nd Generation Drobo populated with four WD 1TB Green Drives for $849, you can. Just use the code MYDL849 at the&#194;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.Drobostore.com/">Drobostore</a>&#8211;Valid through 3/31/09.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Now that post says that the drawing and coupon are only good until 3/31 and of course it is now 4/17, but <a href="http://www.twitter.com/drobo">@drobo</a> did post this tweet last night:</p>

  <blockquote>
