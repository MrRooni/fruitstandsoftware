  <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-19" href="http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2008/07/mac-developer-roundtable/blocks_image_0_1/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19" title="macdeveloperroundtable" src="http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/blocks_image_0_1.png" alt="macdeveloperroundtable" width="300" height="300"></a>I had the good fortune of recording another episode of the Mac Developer Roundtable a few weeks ago and that episode is now live on the Mac Developer Network site.</p>

  <p>We have a rousing discussion on code reuse and all its pluses and minuses, &#194;&nbsp;I highly recommend giving it a listen.</p>

  <p>This episode is free, but the Mac Developer Network also provides a large amount of fantastic premium content including video training courses, free software, software discounts, plus access to other podcasts that are not available to non-members. &#194;&nbsp;Head on over to MDN&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/membership/">Why Join?</a> page to find out more.</p>
