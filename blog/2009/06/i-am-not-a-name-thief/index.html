  <h1>I am Not a Name Thief</h1><a href="index.html" title="10:25 AM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p>Not intentionally, anyway. First a little back story: When I was trying to decide on a name for this blog I would come up with what I thought was a great name and then plug it into Google to make sure that it wasn&#8217;t already taken. Most of the time I would find a blog that already had the same name and move on to a new round of brainstorming. When I arrived at the name &#8220;Cocoa Nut&#8221; I thought for sure it would be taken. I did a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22cocoa+nut%22">quick search</a> but found no hits for that name having anything to do with programming in the first few pages of search results. I thought, much to my amazement, that I had struck blog naming gold, I couldn&#8217;t believe my luck!</p>

  <p>Fast forward to last week. I was looking up some show notes on the <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/">Mac Developer Network</a> when I noticed the blog roll on the side of the page. Curious if my blog was listed there (I had submitted it to Scotty a while back) I took a quick glance through the list and saw <a href="http://cocoa-nut.de/">Cocoa Nut</a> sandwiched between <a href="http://www.wilshipley.com/blog/">Call Me Fishmeal</a> and <a href="http://cocoasamurai.blogspot.com/">Cocoa Samurai</a>. I clicked through expecting to be greeted with my blog&#8217;s homepage but was instead taken to a different Cocoa Nut.</p>

  <div id="attachment_263" style="width: 772px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
    <a rel="attachment wp-att-263" href="http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2009/06/i-am-not-a-name-thief/original-cocoa-nut-header/"><img class="size-full wp-image-263" title="Original Cocoa Nut Header" src="http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Original-Cocoa-Nut-Header.png" alt="The original Cocoa Nut" width="762" height="213"></a>

  <p>Astounded, I quickly checked his archives, sure that he had shown up on the scene after me and had not been thorough enough in his search for naming collisions. 2006. His first post was from 2006. My first post was in 2008. I was sunk.</p>

  <p>So back to the title of this post: I am not a name thief. I am currently searching for a new moniker for this blog. Yes, I could make the argument that in a fully qualified world his Cocoa Nut and my Cocoa Nut are in completely different namespaces and that they don&#8217;t collide, but that&#8217;s BS and everyone would know it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, if you&#8217;d like to suggest a name, please feel free. Otherwise, I will be thinking and Googling until I come up with something that no one else has thought of yet.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/link/index.html" title="View all posts in Link" rel="category tag">Link</a>, <a href="../../../category/news/index.html" title="View all posts in News" rel="category tag">News</a> and tagged <a href="../../../tag/mistakes/index.html" rel="tag">mistakes</a>, <a href="../../../tag/naming/index.html" rel="tag">naming</a>, <a href="../../../tag/thief/index.html" rel="tag">thief</a>.
