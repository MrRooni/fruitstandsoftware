  <h2>Sponsoring The WWDC 2013 Photo Walk</h2>
  <hr>

  <p>If you haven't heard, the second annual <a href="http://www.fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2013/05/wwdc-2013-photo-walk/">WWDC Photo Walk is set for Wednesday June 12th at 6:15 PM</a>. If you'd like to sponsor the walk I'd love to have you on board. Now you may be asking yourself, "Sponsorship? What costs are associated with a photo walk?" Well that's the beauty of it, there are none! Sponsorship in this case means having your product or company name listed in the walk details, promoted on the <a href="http://twitter.com/wwdcphotowalk">WWDC Photo Walk Twitter account</a>, and promoted within the <a href="https://app.glassboard.com/web/invitation/code/nyzzu">WWDC Photo Walk Glassboard</a> in exchange for some promo codes or discounts given out to the walk participants.</p>

  <p>For instance, last year we had <a href="http://www.fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2012/06/wwdc-2012-photo-walk/">500px sponsor us</a> with one Awesome and one Plus account for the two folks <a href="http://www.fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2012/06/wwdc-2012-photo-walk-wrap-up/">whose photos were the best</a>.</p>

  <p>So if you're interested please send me an email at michael at this domain and we'll get the ball rolling.</p>
