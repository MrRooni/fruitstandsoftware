  <h1>stevenf.com: How To Report a Bug</h1><a href="index.html" title="12:10 PM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p>Steven Frank (of <a href="http://panic.com/">Panic</a> fame) has posted a great article on his site: <a href="http://stevenf.com/archive/reporting-bugs-in-mac-os-x-apps.php">How to report a bug in a Mac OS X application</a></p>

  <p>Here&#8217;s the teaser:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Bugs happen. It&#8217;s a fact of life. Although you may not be in the mood at the exact moment they strike, the best possible thing you can do is file a bug report with the developer. You may not get an immediate solution, but you will provide extremely valuable forensic information that should help the developer fix the problem over the long term. Here&#8217;s how to report a bug effectively.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Developers hate having bugs discovered by their users, but hate getting lousy bug reports even more. I&#8217;m tempted to include a variant of this article in the Help section of my next app under the heading, <strong>What should I do if I think I&#8217;ve found a bug?</strong></p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/debugging/index.html" title="View all posts in Debugging" rel="category tag">Debugging</a>, <a href="../../../category/link/index.html" title="View all posts in Link" rel="category tag">Link</a>.

        <p>I&#8217;ve had a few users email me with crash logs, which makes the problem so much easier to diagnose. I think I&#8217;ll have to add a section to my website on submitting bugs.</p>
