  <p>If you&#8217;re a fan of <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/podcasts/">Scotty&#8217;s podcasts</a> (though who isn&#8217;t, I mean really&#8230;) and you think you can stand to listen to me and 6 other guys ramble on about developer groups for 1 hour, 34 minutes and 4 seconds head on over to <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/">Mac-Developer-Network.com</a> and download <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/blog/?id=3469474814738280918">the latest episode of The Mac Developer Roundtable</a>.</p>

  <p>I was lucky enough to be joined by a great crew of developers: <a href="http://www.mamooba.com/">Scotty</a> (of course), <a href="http://www.random-ideas.net/">Jiva DeVoe</a>, <a href="http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/">Joe Heck</a>, <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/">Paul Kim</a>, <a href="http://shinydevelopment.com/">Dave Verwer</a> and <a href="http://rentzsch.com/">Jonathan &#8220;Wolf&#8221; Rentzsch</a>.</p>

  <p>This is my second time recording a podcast with Scotty and I think I did a lot better than my first outing. Hopefully Scotty still feels that I&#8217;m a worthwhile guest and I&#8217;ll get to polish my skills a bit more in the future.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/downloads/index.html" title="View all posts in Downloads" rel="category tag">Downloads</a>, <a href="../../../category/link/index.html" title="View all posts in Link" rel="category tag">Link</a>.
