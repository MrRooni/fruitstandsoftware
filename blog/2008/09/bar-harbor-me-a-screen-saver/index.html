  <h1>Bar Harbor, ME: A Screen Saver</h1><a href="index.html" title="10:09 PM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p>A couple of years ago I whipped up a photo screen saver bundle from some photos that I took while my wife and I were on our second honeymoon. I&#8217;ve always meant to release it, but have just not gotten around to whipping up a download page for it or uploading it to MacUpdate or Apple Downloads.</p>

  <p>That being said, I&#8217;ve decided to provide it here for now, just to get it into a few folks hands and maybe even gather some feedback on it. It&#8217;s a doozy of a download (47.3 MB) but it contains 12 high resolution photos in and around Bar Harbor.</p>

  <p>Grab it here: <a href="http://fruitstandsoftware.com/BarHarborME.slideSaver.tbz">BarHarborME.slideSaver.tbz</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
