  <p>There&#8217;s a great post on The Daydream Blog about coming up to speed with Cocoa development. One paragraph really rang true for me:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Every time you try to learn a new aspect of Cocoa, you find yourself struggling to do something that feels like the &#226;&#8364;&#339;right way&#226;&#8364;. A few days later you come out with 3 lines of code that feel completely natural but felt incredibly painful to reach. You will be met with countless, &#226;&#8364;&#339;aaah, that&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s how it works and it makes complete sense&#226;&#8364; moments. You spend days wondering why this bit of Cocoa is so gnarly, and seemingly unintuitive, until you reach another moment of understanding.</p>
