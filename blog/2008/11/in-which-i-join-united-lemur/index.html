  <p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-84" style="border: 3px solid white;" title="unitedlemurlogo" src="http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/unitedlemurlogo-300x300.png" alt="unitedlemurlogo" width="300" height="300">The past few weeks have been quite the whirlwind of activity here at Camp Fruit Stand, and I have some exciting news: I am now an intern at <a href="http://unitedlemur.org/">United Lemur</a>, working on an iPhone game for them, and loving every minute of it.</p>

  <p>As I look back at the date on my last post I&#8217;m not surprised that it&#8217;s been over a month since I last had a chance to put anything into print. Any free time that I have had has been spent either working on the house or reading the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/iphone/">developer documentation from Apple</a> on how to write software for the iPhone.</p>

  <p>Even though I&#8217;m the &#8220;new guy&#8221; everyone has welcomed me with open arms and instantly made me feel like a member of the team. From day one I was given a new name (I am now known as Mike McChristopher among my fellow lemurs), a new email address, and full responsibility for a project that will result in another great United Lemur app in the App Store.</p>

  <p>It has also been fantastic to be behind the scenes in the troop&#8217;s chat room as their initial foray, <a href="http://puzzllotto.com/">Puzzllotto</a>, has played out and to watch as they prep their next big thing.</p>

  <p>I think one of the best things about having the opportunity to join this troop is that I am part of an incredibly talented group of developers, designers, and engineers that aren&#8217;t just doing this to get rich. Something great happens to a person when they are exposed to others in their field that are so obviously passionate about what they do.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;d also like to take a few words to thank <a href="http://atomicwang.org/motherfucker/">Mike Lee</a>. From the beginning Mike has been one of the nicest, most easy going, easily approachable guys I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure to meet. He has given me an incredible opportunity by allowing me to join him in his crusade to save the lemurs and for that I thank him.</p>

  <p>Now don&#8217;t worry, I will still be creating new posts here (in fact I&#8217;ve got a couple in the queue already), but be warned: my future posts might have a bit of lemur scent on them.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/news/index.html" title="View all posts in News" rel="category tag">News</a> and tagged <a href="../../../tag/iphone/index.html" rel="tag">iPhone</a>, <a href="../../../tag/new-job/index.html" rel="tag">New job</a>, <a href="../../../tag/news/index.html" rel="tag">News</a>, <a href="../../../tag/united-lemur/index.html" rel="tag">United Lemur</a>.
