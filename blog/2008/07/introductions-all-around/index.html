  <h1>Introductions All Around</h1><a href="index.html" title="9:08 AM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p>Since this is the first post on the new Fruit Stand Software blog I suppose I should take a few words to introduce myself and tell you what I hope to accomplish:</p>

  <p>My name is Michael Fey and I am a coder, a longtime Mac user, and a self-proclaimed geek.</p>

  <p>My plan is to use this blog to post news about my Cocoa programming exploits, things I learn how to do, topics that we cover at CocoaHeads, and links to posts on other sites that I find useful.</p>

  <p>That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m writing here for now. I don&#8217;t want this to become a long-winded explanation about why you should read my blog because if I&#8217;m doing my job right than its content should answer that question for me.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" title="View all posts in Uncategorized" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
