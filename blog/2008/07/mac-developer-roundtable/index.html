		<h1>Mac Developer Roundtable</h1>


			<a href="index.html" title="4:54 PM" rel="bookmark"><time class="entry-date" datetime="2008-07-21T16:54:50+00:00">July 21, 2008</time></a>		</div>



		<p>I was fortunate enough to be invited by <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/">Steve Scott (Scotty)</a> to be on <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/podcasts/macdeveloperroundtable/episode10/index.html">the latest Mac Developer Roundtable podcast</a> with <a href="http://dannygreg.com/">Danny Greg</a> and <a href="http://www.cimgf.com/">Marcus Zarra</a>.  We recorded for 3 hours and it was a ton of fun (don&#8217;t worry, the edited version was only 1.5 hours long).  We covered a wide range of topics from the new iPhone, new technologies and how and why we use them, how Windows programmers view our development tools and the usual round of &#8220;developer picks&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac developer and are not currently subscribed to <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/podcasts/">The Mac Developer Network podcasts</a> I highly recommend heading over to Scotty&#8217;s site and checking it out.  Scotty is a fantastic and gracious host and runs a great podcast.<br />
