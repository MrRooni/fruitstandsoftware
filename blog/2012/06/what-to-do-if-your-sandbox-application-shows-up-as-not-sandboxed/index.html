  <h1>What To Do If Your Sandboxed Application Shows Up As Not Sandboxed</h1><a href="index.html" title="7:23 PM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p>This afternoon I started working on turning&#194;&nbsp;<a href="http://nothirst.com/moneywell/" target="_blank">MoneyWell for Mac</a> into a sandboxed application for our next major release. I watched the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/app-sandbox/" target="_blank">intro videos</a>, checked the appropriate checkboxes in Xcode, ran&#194;&nbsp;MoneyWell, checked Activity Monitor and saw&#8230;</p>

  <p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Activity-Monitor-1-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-571" title="MoneyWellNotSandboxed" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Activity-Monitor-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="630"></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Well crap. After a bit of unsuccessful searching on the <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/community/mac?view=discussions" target="_blank">Apple Dev Forums</a> I did some testing with&#194;&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/kevinhoctor" target="_blank">Kevin Hoctor</a> and discovered that the <strong>Release</strong> configuration of&#194;&nbsp;MoneyWell was properly sandboxed. The only significant difference between the <strong>Release</strong> and <strong>Debug</strong> configurations was that one was code signed and one was not. Once we enabled code signing for the <strong>Debug</strong> configuration&#194;&nbsp;MoneyWell launched as a sandboxed app.</p>

  <p>I asked on Twitter,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://twitter.com/MrRooni/status/210136419224649728" target="_blank">Is it common knowledge that an app that is not code signed will run in non-sandboxed mode even with sandboxing enabled?</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Both Brian Webster and Jim Correia got back to me:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://twitter.com/bwebster" target="_blank">@bwebster</a>:&#194;&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/bwebster/status/210142826468618240" target="_blank">That does make sense, since it is the code sign tool that&#8217;s used to encode the sandbox entitlements when building.</a></p>

    <p><a href="http://twitter.com/jimcorreia" target="_blank">@jimcorreia</a>:&#194;&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/jimcorreia/status/210143389579096065" target="_blank">The app-sandbox is an entitlement. Entitlements are embedded in the code signature.</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Hopefully this helps you out if you find that your sandboxed app is showing up as not sandboxed.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/cocoa/index.html" title="View all posts in Cocoa" rel="category tag">Cocoa</a>.
