  <h1 style="text-align: left;">The Long Winded Version</h1>

  <p>During WWDC we have an awesome opportunity to get together with other photo geeks and make some great photos of one of the coolest cities in the world. As such, I figured it would be cool to organize a photo walk. We&#8217;ll meet up on the <a title="Powell Street BART on Google Maps" href="http://goo.gl/maps/AW4G" target="_blank">street at the Powell Street BART</a> at 6:30 on Wednesday, June 13th. There are usually a good number of street performers around so it should make for a great location to wait while everyone shows up. Shortly thereafter we&#8217;ll head <a title="Walking route from Powell Street BART to the Ferry Building" href="http://goo.gl/maps/lMXI" target="_blank">down Market Street towards the Ferry Building</a>&#194;&nbsp;and then see where the winds take us.</p>

  <p>Sunset is at <a title="Sunrise and sunset times in San Francisco during June, 2012" href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=224&amp;month=6&amp;year=2012&amp;obj=sun&amp;afl=-11&amp;day=1" target="_blank">8:33PM</a> and between San Francisco Bay and the Oakland Bay Bridge we should be able to make some great photos (if we decide to stay out that long).</p>

  <p>There&#8217;s no need to RSVP, but it&#8217;d be great to know if you&#8217;re coming so please send me a message on <a href="http://twitter.com/MrRooni">Twitter</a> or an email to michael at this domain.</p>
