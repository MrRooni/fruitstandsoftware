  <p><a href="http://500px.com/photo/8672882"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-581" title="Oakland Bay Bridge Pano" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Oakland-Bay-Bridge-Pano.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="353"></a></p>

  <p>The <a title="WWDC 2012 Photo Walk sponsored by 500px" href="../wwdc-2012-photo-walk/index.html">WWDC 2012 Photo Walk sponsored by 500px</a> was a huge success! We had an incredible turnout that, quite honestly, blew me away.</p>

  <p>As a last minute surprise we had the fine folks from <a href="http://www.speckproducts.com/iphone-case/iphone-4-case.html" target="_blank">Speck</a> come out to demonstrate their upcoming CandyShell Focus case for iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. To cap it all off they handed out a bunch of them to the attendees. I&#8217;ve had mine on my phone since the walk and I love it. I&#8217;ll admit I don&#8217;t do too much photography with my phone, but I have found myself using the stand for FaceTime calls and just for standing up the phone on my desk. If you&#8217;d like more info on it you should get in touch with Erica on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/2bmighty" target="_blank">@2bmighty</a>, and tell her <a href="http://twitter.com/MrRooni" target="_blank">@MrRooni</a> sent you. (Not for any good reason, but let&#8217;s be honest, it&#8217;s just fun to end a sentence with, &#8220;tell them I sent you&#8221;)</p>

  <p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CandyShellFocusBySpeck.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-580" title="CandyShell Focus By Speck" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CandyShellFocusBySpeck.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533"></a></p>

  <p>We also had the guys from <a href="http://macphun.com" target="_blank">MacPhun</a> show up and very generously offer a free license to their new photography product, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapheal/id480623975?mt=12" target="_blank">Snapheal</a>, to everyone who attended. If you went on the walk and you&#8217;d like a copy of Snapheal just send an email to me (michael [at] this domain) and Alex Tsepko (atsepko [at] macphun) with your favorite photo from the walk. I haven&#8217;t actually had a chance to try it out yet, but I heard from a few people on the walk that use MacPhun&#8217;s other photography products and love them.</p>

  <p>As you know, for those that participated in the walk, the editors at <a href="http://500px.com/" target="_blank">500px</a> are going to choose their two favorite photographs from the walk and upgrade those photographer&#8217;s accounts to Plus and Awesome. All you have to do is upload your photos to your 500px account and tag the photos with the tag <a href="http://500px.com/search?tag=WWDC-photowalk" target="_blank">wwdc-photowalk</a>. The last day to upload your best shots for a chance to get your account upgraded is <del>Thursday, June 21st</del> TODAY. You can find my shots in a set on 500px here: <a href="http://500px.com/MrRooni/sets/wwdc_2012_photo_walk_sponsored_by_500px" target="_blank">WWDC 2012 Photo Walk sponsored by 500px</a>. If you&#8217;d like to see all my photos from WWDC you can find them here: <a href="http://500px.com/MrRooni/sets/wwdc_2012" target="_blank">WWDC 2012</a></p>

  <p>I know I mentioned it above, but we really did have a great turnout. So good in fact, that people are already asking me to organize one for next year. To that end I&#8217;ve created a new Twitter account dedicated to the walk: <a href="http://twitter.com/WWDCPhotoWalk" target="_blank">@WWDCPhotoWalk</a>. You should follow that account for any and all info on the next walk.</p>

  <p>Thank you to everyone who came out, you all exceeded my expectations, and I&#8217;ll see you next year.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/link/index.html" title="View all posts in Link" rel="category tag">Link</a>, <a href="../../../category/news/index.html" title="View all posts in News" rel="category tag">News</a>, <a href="../../../category/photography/index.html" title="View all posts in Photography" rel="category tag">Photography</a>.
