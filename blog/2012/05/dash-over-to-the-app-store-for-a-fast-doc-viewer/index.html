  <h1>Dash Over to the App Store For a Fast Doc Viewer</h1><a href="index.html" title="1:54 PM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">A few days ago I started using <a title="Dash" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-docs-snippets/id458034879?mt=12" target="_blank">Dash</a> to view developer documentation. I was immediately blown away by how insanely fast it was. It has quickly become my go-to app for searching and reading documentation. Today I found myself wishing it had better Xcode integration so I checked if the Dash developers had included a system service.</p>

  <div id="attachment_500" style="width: 792px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
    <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Keyboard.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-500" title="Dash Lookup Service" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Keyboard.png" alt="" width="782" height="712"></a>

    <p class="wp-caption-text">The forward-thinking developers of Dash included a system service, huzzah!</p>
  </div>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Success! Now I can simply highlight something in Xcode, hit control+command+L and have it brought it up in Dash.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">If you haven&#8217;t gotten <a title="Dash" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-docs-snippets/id458034879?mt=12" target="_blank">Dash</a> yet, go get it, it&#8217;s awesome.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, did you see what I did with the title there? Pretty clever, huh?</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/cocoa/index.html" title="View all posts in Cocoa" rel="category tag">Cocoa</a>, <a href="../../../category/link/index.html" title="View all posts in Link" rel="category tag">Link</a>.
