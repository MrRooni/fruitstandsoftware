  <h1>The Awesomeness That Is Bodega</h1><a href="index.html" title="12:18 PM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://appbodega.com/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-464 alignleft" title="Bodega" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Bodega-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a>Let&#8217;s get one thing out of the way first thing: I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://appbodega.com/">Bodega</a> and have been since I heard about it firsthand from the guys at <a href="http://centrix.ca/">centrix.ca</a> during WWDC 2009.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bodega is a free Mac application that helps you discover and download Mac applications. It is built in the spirit of great software sites like <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/">MacUpdate</a>, but takes the experience and puts a great looking Cocoa wrapper around it. Make no mistake, this project is a big undertaking with a lot of moving parts and a lot of coordination between those parts. Yet with steady progress and determination these guys are really crafting something cool.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">The impetus for this particular blog post is to gush about what I think is Bodega&#8217;s killer feature: keeping track of and installing updates for the applications installed on your computer. I really like <a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschack&#8217;s Sparkle framework</a>, but one of the necessary evils of that framework is that it doesn&#8217;t notify you that there is an update for a particular app until you run that app. When I launch an application it is done with the intention of performing a task immediately, but if there&#8217;s an update for that particular app I am yanked out of my workflow to deal with the question of updating the app first. Yes, I can continue to work, but in the back of my mind I&#8217;m thinking about how I don&#8217;t have the latest version of the software that I am currently using, and it bugs me.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">Enter Bodega. Once every few weeks I will launch Bodega and click on the Applications section in its sidebar which presents me with a list of all the software currently installed on my system*. The killer feature is that Bodega scans all of the Sparkle feeds in these apps and will tell me if there&#8217;s an update for any of them. With two clicks (one to download and one to install) I can download and install any of the updates that I want. This simple process greatly reduces the chance that the next time I launch an app I will be presented with the option to download and install an update, Bodega has already taken care of it for me.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">If you haven&#8217;t <a href="http://appbodega.com/">downloaded Bodega</a> yet I highly recommend that you do and take it for a spin. If you&#8217;re a developer and you haven&#8217;t <a href="http://appbodega.com/Developers.php">submitted your software to Bodega</a>, I highly recommend that you do that too.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">* Bodega is opt-in for developers, so if a developer hasn&#8217;t submitted their software to the Bodega site it won&#8217;t know about that software on your computer.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/downloads/index.html" title="View all posts in Downloads" rel="category tag">Downloads</a>, <a href="../../../category/link/index.html" title="View all posts in Link" rel="category tag">Link</a>, <a href="../../../category/review/index.html" title="View all posts in Review" rel="category tag">Review</a> and tagged <a href="../../../tag/review/index.html" rel="tag">Review</a>, <a href="../../../tag/sparkle/index.html" rel="tag">Sparkle</a>, <a href="../../../tag/wwdc/index.html" rel="tag">WWDC</a>.
