  <h1>Sponsoring the WWDC 2013 Photo Walk</h1><a href="index.html" title="3:49 PM" rel="bookmark"></a>

  <p>If you haven&#8217;t heard, the second annual <a href="../wwdc-2013-photo-walk/index.html">WWDC Photo Walk is set for Wednesday June 12th at 6:15 PM</a>. If you&#8217;d like to sponsor the walk I&#8217;d love to have you on board. Now you may be asking yourself, &#8220;Sponsorship? What costs are associated with a photo walk?&#8221; Well that&#8217;s the beauty of it, there are none! Sponsorship in this case means having your product or company name listed in the walk details, promoted on the <a href="http://twitter.com/wwdcphotowalk">WWDC Photo Walk Twitter account</a>, and promoted within the <a href="https://app.glassboard.com/web/invitation/code/nyzzu">WWDC Photo Walk Glassboard</a> in exchange for some promo codes or discounts given out to the walk participants.</p>

  <p>For instance, last year we had <a href="../../../2012/06/wwdc-2012-photo-walk/index.html">500px sponsor us</a> with one Awesome and one Plus account for the two folks <a href="../../../2012/06/wwdc-2012-photo-walk-wrap-up/index.html">whose photos were the best</a>.</p>

  <p>So if you&#8217;re interested please send me an email at michael at this domain and we&#8217;ll get the ball rolling.</p>This entry was posted in <a href="../../../category/cocoa/index.html" title="View all posts in Cocoa" rel="category tag">Cocoa</a>.
